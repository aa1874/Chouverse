title: Submitting Your Work
note: >-
    Make sure you add front matter on your pages, like this! Front matter began and end with "---" (three dashes) on a single line.
    If you want to use multiline, make sure the first line of the variable value is ">-"!
andfinally: Front matter is needed as a Markdown equivalent to wiki infoboxes.
