## What is Chouverse?

### Philosophy
The main driving force for this project is **public domain.**

There are many shared universes in this world. Many of them are under copyright... Which is the reason why I made Chouverse: so that people can contribute into a shared universe without even asking permission.

### Planned things inside

#### General
The Chouverse is beyond just one universe: it's a multiverse. A collection of universes. Timelines. Too many civilizations. Some went postorganic (aka: went into singularity). Most haven't or don't want to yet.

Some of those civilizations are AGI ([artificial general intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)) civilizations (i.e. civilizations composed of mostly AGIs, or all of its inhabitants being AGIs), or civilizations led by AGIs--known as AI nations--some of them being led by benevolent AGIs, others are malevolent.

In some areas, there might be wars and invasions.
