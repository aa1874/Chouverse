## Philosophy

There are many shared-universes in this world that are awesome; unfortunately they are copyrighted and you might need permission to contribute to the 'verse. Which is the reason why Chouverse is licensed under WTFPL (above): **to encourage public contribution by making it free for all, without limitations.**
